"""
analysis_engine_patch.py — SentinelTrace v2 Pipeline Bridge
============================================================
Bridges the original run_full_analysis with the new unified pipeline
(baseline, sequence engine, decision layer, etc.).

FIXES vs root-level analysis_engine_patch.py:
  1. Loads events directly from sentinel_cases with correct column names.
  2. Extracts actual_run_id from context to handle upload vs analysis run_id mismatch.
  3. Passes both events_df and detections_df to the pipeline rather than None.
